# TODO LIST:

* how to visualize selection paths of actions from a markov chain???

* make heatmap work for all strategies...

* make presentation with all results

* Monte Carlo Simulation run for each individual modeling problem (function) could work better...
* Could also combine that with Reinforcement learning...
