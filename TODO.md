# TODO LIST:

* recode the entire case study code from scratch
* identify the bug, and why it takes so long the analysis
* it should actually run really fast, especially for 2 parameter case with only 7 kernels as for lulesh...

* find out how much budget min for lulesh
* find out min budget for other case studies as well....

###########################################

* how to visualize selection paths of actions from a markov chain???

* make heatmap work for all strategies...

* case study analsis
    * minife
    * lulesh
    * fastest
    * kripke
    * quicksilver

* make presentation with all results

##########################


* Monte Carlo Simulation run for each individual modeling problem (function) could work better...
* Could also combine that with Reinforcement learning...
