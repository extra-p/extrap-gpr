# TODO LIST:

* finish update of case study code, plotting needs to be checked and fixed
* autmatic analysis scripts and workflow for case studies like for synth eval
* fix base value nr bug, when rep==base_value
* single plot function for case studies to present results automatically



* wait and check if 4 param runs through completely with 23h wallclock time
* if yes run same for 2,5,10% noise levels
* save final synth measurements for 4 params in repo and archive folder

###########################################

* how to visualize selection paths of actions from a markov chain???

* make heatmap work for all strategies...

* run synthetic analysis for4 parameters with different budgets and noise levels and make the plots

* introduce all updates in synth eval code into case study code to achieve similar results for case studies

* do kripke analysis
* create kripke plots
* make quicksilver analysis
* create quicksilver plots

* make presentation with all results


##########################


* Monte Carlo Simulation run for each individual modeling problem (function) could work better...
* Could also combine that with Reinforcement learning...
