# TODO LIST:

* get noise plot correct with all case studies with just one function call...
* add documentation for it into README.md


* viz code for noise levels on case study measurements...

* how to visualize selection paths of actions from a markov chain???

* make heatmap work for all strategies...

* case study analsis
    * minife
    * lulesh
    * fastest
    * kripke
    * quicksilver

* make presentation with all results

##########################


* Monte Carlo Simulation run for each individual modeling problem (function) could work better...
* Could also combine that with Reinforcement learning...
