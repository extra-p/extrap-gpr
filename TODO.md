# TODO LIST:

* number additional points calculation is incorrect, need to calc with the repetitions...


###########################################

* how to visualize selection paths of actions from a markov chain???

* especially for 3 and more parameters the interesting part of the cost, accuracy analysis is going to be the area between 0 and 1%...

I need to analyze that...

* make heatmap work for all strategies...

* Monte Carlo Simulation run for each individual modeling problem (function) could work better...
* Could also combine that with Reinforcement learning...

* maybe the formula that rates the points for selection in the GPR strategy is wrong... I should take a look at what point it chooses, always cheapest? And how that behavior changes when I adjust that formula...


* run synthetic analysis for 2,3,4 parameters with different budgets and noise levels and make the plots

* do kripke analysis
* create kripke plots
* make quicksilver analysis
* create quicksilver plots

* make presentation with all results
