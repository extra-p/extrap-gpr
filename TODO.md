# TODO LIST:


* autmatic analysis scripts and workflow for case studies like for synth eval
* fix base value nr bug, when rep==base_value
* single plot function for case studies to present results automatically


* save final synth measurements for 4 params in repo and archive folder

###########################################

* how to visualize selection paths of actions from a markov chain???

* make heatmap work for all strategies...

* run synthetic analysis for4 parameters with different budgets and noise levels and make the plots

* introduce all updates in synth eval code into case study code to achieve similar results for case studies

* do kripke analysis
* create kripke plots
* make quicksilver analysis
* create quicksilver plots

* make presentation with all results


##########################


* Monte Carlo Simulation run for each individual modeling problem (function) could work better...
* Could also combine that with Reinforcement learning...
